# Slade Hirschi Resume

## This is my (work in process) weh app hosted on heroku with a free tier AWS database.

### Technologies include: React.js • Typescript • Node.js ª MySql

## Login
* To login and see my resume info use:
  * email: sladehirschi@gmail.com
  * password: resume1234
* Login with google just to bypass the login screen basically, your user will not be saved (see future work*)

## Sign Up
* You may also sign up with your own account and create data for your user, which will persist
* Pssword encryption is done with bcrypt

## Notes:
* I started this project on September 18, so I haven't had much time to work on it that's why there's a not much to see
* I am still in school and have been working part time another reason why there's not a lot

## Future Work:
* Store users that sign in with google, and store their sub in the database to associate
* Verify JWT's in backend to ensure they are valid and not expired
* Add functionality to create project cards in projects section
